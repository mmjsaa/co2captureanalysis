# Carbon Dioxide Capture Analysis 

## Contents
A set of Python codes used to calculate various parameters of various models used for the analysis of adsorption of carbon dioxide ($\ce{CO2}$). These codes can be used for analysing and standing the $\ce{CO2}$ capture ability of different adsorbents. Sample data is provided, however, all data is made up and should not be referenced, it is only to be used as an example. These codes were used to aid in the numerical analysis of my obtained experimental data for my dissertation and publication (in progress). Initially, Excel was used but it was to tedious to use the Solver add-in for each piece of data, so I wrote these codes.

## Introduction 
Greenhouse gas emissions continue to be an issue for our environment in the battle to mitigate climate change, with the 2050 target of net zero emissions coming closer. There are several sources of these emissions, but a large contributor is $\ce{CO2}$ from power plants. As a result, carbon capture, utilisation, and storage technologies have began to gain popularity and have recieved attention in recent years as a method for mitigating $\ce{CO2}$ emissions, as well as utilising the captured $\ce{CO2}$ in a number of industries. Another issue is plastic waste we are currently battling. Oceans have become litered with plastic waste, harming marine life, such as most notably in recent years, turtles. Typically, plastic waste is sent to landfills, however, plastic landfilling poses several environmental challenges, including the potential for leachate formation and the release of harmful substances. Over time, plastic materials in landfills may undergo slow degradation, contributing to long term environmental concerns. As we seek sustainable waste management solutions, there is an increasing focus on reducing plastic use, promoting recycling, and exploring alternative waste treatment technologies to mitigate the environmental impact associated with plastic landfilling. 

One way to minimise both of these, is by using plastic waste to produce activated carbons for $\ce{CO2}$ capture. My study aimed to investigate feasibility of this, and compare activated carbons produced by using plastic waste as a precursor with other activated carbon materials to analyse the strength of their performance. Following the conclusion of my study, it was found that this is, indeed, a viable and feasible method for reducing $\ce{CO2}$ emissions and tackling plastic waste pollution, and should be explored more, especially with the increasing focus on battling climate change.
