# Carbon Dioxide Capture Analysis 

## Contents
A set of Python codes used to calculate various parameters of various models used for the analysis of adsorption of carbon dioxide ($\ce{CO2}$). These codes can be used for analysing and standing the $\ce{CO2}$ capture ability of different adsorbents. Sample data is provided, however, all data is made up and should not be referenced, it is only to be used as an example. These codes were used to aid in the numerical analysis of my obtained experimental data for my dissertation and publication (in progress). Initially, Excel was used but it was to tedious to use the Solver add-in for each piece of data, so I wrote these codes.
